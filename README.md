Hi, I'm Leroymilo on the Internet.
I code in python, C++, C# and Godotscript.
I know how to use SQL.
I can do a wide range of things from (kinda) advanced algorithms to event driven logic, including things like data processing and optimisation problems.

I'm open for new projects using what I already know or to learn about new languages.

I mainly code games but I also have a scientific and mathematical education for science stuff.

And sorry for bad English.
