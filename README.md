Hi, I'm Leroymilo on Internet.
I code in python or in C++ (with SFML and jsonCpp).
I know how to use SQL with SQLite.
I can do a wide range of things from (kinda) advanced algorithms to event driven logic, including things like data processing and optimisation problems.

I'm open for new projects using what I already know or to learn about new languages (I plan on learning java in the near future).

I mainly code games but I also have a scientific and mathematical education for science stuff.

And sorry for bad English.
